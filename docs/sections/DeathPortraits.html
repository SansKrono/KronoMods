		<h1>Death Portraits</h1>
		<p>
			This is mostly like <a href="CharacterMenu.html">Character menu</a>, open <b>death portraits.png</b> with your editor
			remove what I put in there and replace it with your content.
		</p>
		<p>
			you do not need to do anything for the tainted character unless you're like me and made the character have a different name
			on the tainted side OMEGA instead of ALPHA. If you did just make sure to put your tainted character's name in there too.
		</p>
		<h1>Death Portraits anm2</h1>
		<b>If you skipped the second part of <a href="CharacterMenu.html">Character menu</a> now go back and do that and this section at the same time</b>
		<p>
			Ok, now we just need to do the death screen anm2, so open <b>death screen.anm2</b><br>
			Duplicate Alpha, renaming it your characters name.<br>
			Then delete Alpha.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now this is where it's a little different, the only thing you need to change in this file is the Name sprite.
			If you want to change other things go ahead of course, but I won't be covering that.
		</p>
		<p>
		Once your done save it.<br><br>

		For your tainted character you need to do the same thing, but in <b>death screen alt.anm2</b>.
		</p>
