		<h1>Stage Portrait Image</h1>
		<p>
			In this section, we will create the player portrait used when changing floors or when you enter a boss arena.
		</p>
		<p>
			the file we are creating can be found in ".\resources\gfx\ui\stage"
		</p>
		<p>
			You can do this however you would like, but I would suggest creating a copy of my files and editing them from there.<br>
			If you do choose to do it by hand, the file needs to be <b>144 x 144</b> in size.<br>
			Once you've got the image, save it as <b>playerportrait_charactername.png</b> (lowercase the name).<br>
			For your tainted image, if they have a different name, just do what was done above.
			If they have the same name, just add "_b" to the end of the file name.
		</p>
		<p>
			Repeat this step for your tainted character if they are different.<br><br>

			Example of what it will look like in game if done correctly.<br>
