# Isaac Templates
A collection of mod templates for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (AB+ and Rep)

you can get the latest release of the character template in [here](https://github.com/manaphoenix/IsaacTemplates/releases)

once downloaded unzip the file, put it into your mods folder, and open the readme which will guide the rest of the way!

# Notes
If you notice any bugs REPORT THEM. There is an issues tab in the top left you can use, or contact me directly in the Isaac Discord (@Mana). I can't fix something I don't know is an issue.

The same thing goes for additions/changes. If there is a feature you want to do with your character that my template doesn't cover, let it as a suggestion.
