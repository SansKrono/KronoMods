# Isaac Templates
A collection of mod templates for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.
**THESE TEMPLATES ARE FOR REPENTANCE ONLY**

**Each folder is a mod, they have nothing to do with one another.**
**DOCS IS NOT A MOD, it is the GitHub page for this repo.**

you can get the latest release of any template [here](https://github.com/manaphoenix/IsaacTemplates/releases/tag/latest)

*Does not include WIP templates*

Once downloaded, unzip the folder.
Place it into the mods folder of your isaac install (check guide for how to get to install location)
There is a Guide inside the folder that you can open,
opening it will guide you the rest of the way.

# Notes
For Bugs or Suggestions/Requests. You can use the issues tab in the top left of this page.
Remember, bugs not reported are bugs that won't get fixed!
There is a version number in the top right of your Guide on the index.html page (Intro).
When posting bugs please provide that number :)

You cannot mod unless you have a legitimate Steam copy of the game.

The latest release will never show as updated, this is because a bot handles the upload. Instead there is a version number in the top right of the index.html of the guide.
