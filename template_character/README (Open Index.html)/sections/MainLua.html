			Ok, now that we have all the Image stuff out of the way. lets actually get your characters base items/stats setup.<br>
			go back to the root of your mod , then go into the mod folder, and open <b>stats.lua</b><br><br>
			
			There is no need to open the main.lua file, and <b>imports.lua</b> is for people who know what its for. if you do not need the imports.lua file just delete it.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is instructions in the file of what you need to do, even if you have 0 experience with coding it shouldn't be
			difficult to setup the file.<br><br>

			you can remove the comments if you <i>want</i> when your done. but leaving them there won't harm anything :)
