On the right side when you will see Owner Controls

if you have more images you can add/remove that from "Add/edit images & videos"

what is recommended you do at least tho is go down to "Add/Remove Required DLC" and select the DLC that your mod needs to run
(MODDING only if you have mininum AB+, but be sure to also select Repentance if your mod uses stuff from it)

once done, the only thing you may need to change is the Visibility back to Public, and there you go you did it!
don't forget to post in #promotion in the discord if your part of the isaac modding discord ;)
